# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

This project follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Versioning is intended to follow SemVer once `v1.0.0` is released.

## Compatibility Policy

- The public compatibility boundary is the API and HTTP behavior documented in [README.md](./README.md).
- `internal/*` packages, benchmark layouts, test helpers, and implementation details are not public API.
- Before `v1.0.0`, breaking changes may still happen in minor releases, but they should be called out explicitly in this changelog.
- After `v1.0.0`, breaking public API or HTTP contract changes should only ship in a new major version.

## [Unreleased]

## [v0.1.0] - 2026-03-26

### Highlights

- First public release of `hah`.
- Renamed the module path from `github.com/kanata996/chix` to `github.com/kanata996/hah`.
- Positioned `hah` as a `net/http`-compatible business-boundary JSON API contract library that can be used directly or extended by framework-specific adapters.
- Included the current explicit business-boundary model built around `Contract(...)`, immediate `WriteError(w, r, err)`, explicit `Respond*` success writes, route-scoped mappers/reporters, `reqx`, `errcode`, and request-id bridging.

### Notes

- This repository was reinitialized for `hah`; earlier `chix` tags and release history are not part of this Git history.
